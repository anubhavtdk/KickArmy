            <h2 class="intro"> About our God Kick: </h2>
            <p>Once,Kick was a hard-headed, stubborn, self-tempered 11 year old boy with a surprisingly deep and adult sounding voice, who would never back down from a challenge.
                He always wore a stunt suit and stunt helmet. He was always passionate about extreme stunts. 
                He has got great determination, which occasionally clashes with his temperament. 
            </p>
            <p>However, despite all of this, he had a kind heart, performing many kind acts.
                His damage, which inevitably follows in his wake, is rarely intentional. 
                He has got tolerance to pain, as of when he fell from space and into the earth's crust without flinching.
            </p>
            <p> He grew up to become a young dynamite. He fought goons of Gondabad and freed the people of Gwalior.
                Kick earned the respect of both Politicians and Police after he saved hundreds of hostages from Bowenpally Terror attack.
            </p>
